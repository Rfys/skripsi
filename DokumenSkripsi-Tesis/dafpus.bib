	abstract = {Displacement piles are driven to support a wide range of structures. Predicting their axial limiting capacities and load-displacement behavior is critical to many such engineering applications. Although field load tests may be conducted to check design assumptions, such tests can prove expensive and difficult to generalize. Numerical analyses undertaken to support design face uncertainty over the potentially important effects of pile installation because no well-developed method exists to predict the stresses applying during and after driving. Recent experiments have provided evidence regarding the stresses and strains developed around displacement piles during installation in sand that can help guide representative numerical modeling. This paper contributes to this development by reporting large displacement numerical analyses and linking these to high-quality experiments. The arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian ({ALE}) options available in {ABAQUS} 2016/Explicit have been employed to simulate highly instrumented calibration chamber tests made with closed-ended piles penetrated into sand. Predictions for the stress components developed during and after pile installation are presented, along with measurements made by other authors of the corresponding strain fields. The simulations’ broad agreement with the available experimental evidence indicates that the adopted {ALE} technique and soil modeling approach are appropriate for pile installation analysis in sands. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){GT}.1943-5606.0002271. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The method is based on a large deformation ﬁnite element analysis employing the updated Lagrangian formulation. It can simulate the changing geometry of slopes during failure. An extended Mohr–Coulomb constitutive model represents the strain softening behaviour of slope material. The results of a series of analyses show that the post-failure deformation of slopes is a function of the rate of strength reduction and also the stiffness of the slope material. These two factors inﬂuence the initiation of progressive failure of slopes. The validity of the method is evaluated by simulation of a test embankment failure and comparison of the predicted results with the observed record of the failure.},

In addition, a technique termed ‘element addition’ is developed to improve the computational efﬁciency of both static and dynamic {LDFE} analyses that involve moving boundaries. The {RITSS} approach is based on frequent mesh generation to avoid element distortion. In dynamic {RITSS}, the ﬁeld variables mapped from the old to the new mesh involve not only the stresses and material properties, but also the nodal velocities and accelerations. Using the element addition technique, new soil elements are attached to the domain boundaries periodically when the soil near the boundaries becomes affected by large displacements of the structure. The procedures of this Abaqus-based dynamic {LDFE} analysis and element addition technique are detailed, and the robustness of the techniques is validated and assessed through three example analyses: penetration of a ﬂat footing into a half-space and movement of rigid and deformable landslides down slopes.},

An Eulerian-based ﬁnite-element modelling ({FEM}) of large deformation of soil, for pseudostatic and dynamic loadings, is presented in this study. The Eulerian {FEM} is compared with Lagrangian-based explicit and implicit ﬁnite-element ({FE}) modelling approaches. The dynamic {FE} modelling of two hypothetical slopes for eight earthquake acceleration–time histories show that the failure surfaces develop progressively, which cannot be modelled using the traditional limit equilibrium method ({LEM}). A large plastic shear strain concentration (i.e. shear band formation) occurs when the strain-softening behaviour of soil is considered. The similarities and diﬀerences between the results of dynamic and pseudostatic {FE} analyses based on estimated pseudostatic coeﬃcient from acceleration–time records are presented. The duration of an earthquake inﬂuences the failure process and displacement of the failed soil mass. The displacement of the toe obtained from {FEM} is compared with Newmark's simpliﬁed approach.

	title = {Study of Large Deformation Geomechanical Problems With The Material Point Method},
	abstract = {The numerical simulation of real geomechanical problems often entails an high level of complexity; indeed they are often characterized by large deformations, soilstructure interaction and solid-uid interaction. Moreover, the constitutive behavior of soil is highly non-linear. Landslides, dam failure, pile installation, and underground excavation are typical examples of large deformation problems in which the interaction between solid a uid phase as well as the contact between bodies are essential.
This thesis addresses the challenging issue of the numerical simulation of large deformation problems in geomechanics. The standard lagrangian \_nite element methods are not well suited to treat extremely large deformations because of severe di culties related with mesh distortions. The need to overcome their drawbacks urged researchers to devote considerable e\_ort to the development of more advanced computational techniques such as meshless methods and mesh based particle methods.
In this study, the Material Point Method ({MPM}), which is a mesh based particle method, is exploited to simulate large deformation problems in geomechanics. The {MPM} simulates large displacements with Lagrangian material points ({MP}) moving through a fixed mesh. The {MP} discretize the continuum body and carry all the information such as mass, velocity, acceleration, material properties, stress and strains, as well as external loads. The mesh discretizes the domain where the body move through; it is used to solve the equations of motion, but it does not store any permanent information.
In undrained and drained conditions the presence of water can be simulated in a simpli\_ed way using the one-phase formulation. However, in many cases the relative movement of the water respect to the soil skeleton must be taken into account, thus requiring the use of the two-phase formulation. The contact between bodies is simulated with an algorithm speci\_cally developed for the {MPM} at the beginning of the century. This algorithm was originally formulated for the frictional contact. It extension to the adhesive contact is considered in this thesis, which is well suited to simulate soil-structure interaction in case of cohesive materials.
In this thesis typical geomechanical problems such as the collapse of a submerged slope and the simulation of cone penetration testing are considered. Numerical results are successfully compared with experimental data thus con\_rming the capability of the {MPM} to simulate complex phenomena.},

	title = {Formulation of a Dynamic Material Point Method ({MPM})},
	abstract = {In geomechanics one often encounters large deformations, soil-structure interaction and dynamical problems, e.g., in pile driving and installation of anchors. Moreover, geomechanical phenomena that include excessive movement of soil masses like landslides can pose a danger to human life and property. The numerical simulation of the physics is challenging, particularly if a saturated soil is subjected to dynamic loading, leading to propagation of different waves in the soil.
Because of the reliance of Lagrangian finite element methods ({FEM}) on a mesh, they
are not well suited for the treatment of extremely large deformations of solids. The
need for overcoming this limitation urged researchers throughout the last decades to
devote considerable effort to the development of more advanced computational techniques. Such techniques include the combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian finite element methods, meshless methods and mesh-based particle methods.
The intent of this thesis is to further develop and extend the material point method ({MPM}), which is a mesh-based particle method, for use in geomechanics. {MPM} can be conceived as an extension of {FEM}, in which soil and structural bodies are represented by Lagrangian particles that move through an Eulerian fixed mesh. The physical properties of the continuum reside with particles throughout the computations (deformations), whereas the Eulerian mesh and its Gauss points carry no permanent information. Hence, {MPM} combines the best aspects of both Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations and avoids as much as possible the shortcomings of them. 
Three novel {MPM} development are described in this thesis. In the analysis of geomechanical problems that involve dynamics, absorbing boundaries are introduced to prevent the reflection ofwaves at the selected boundary of the domain. Thewell-known viscous boundaries, which will continuously creep under load, are modified to viscoelastic boundaries by introducing Kelvin-Voigt elements to limit such non-physical displacements.
The novel extension of {MPM} to model the behavior of saturated soils under dynamic loading is formulated. Enhancement of volumetric strains is adopted to mitigate the spurious pressure oscillations which plague low-order finite element implementations. The algorithm is applied to predict the generation and dissipation of pore pressures in a sea dike under heavy dynamic loading by wave attack.
Numerical simulation of pile driving is investigated. Results of shallow and deep penetration are presented. Due to the complex behavior of sand in pile driving, a highly non-linear advanced hypoplastic model is to be used for sand. Explicit Euler forward scheme with sub-stepping technique is used in the integration of this model.
{MPM} is applied to analyze different geomechanical problems, including the collapse of a tunnel face, the instability of a slope and the deep installation of a dynamic anchor. The dynamic {MPM} can be applied to quasi-static problems. To this end, a local damping procedure for single and two-phase materials is discussed, being applied to reach fast convergence to quasi-static equilibrium. Such convergence is detected by two proposed criteria on force and energy. Mass scaling is presented as a procedure that allows the use of large time step size for problems, in which inertia effect can be disregarded.},

	abstract = {Stress oscillations are a common phenomenon in the material point method ({MPM}), since this numerical method typically uses regular finite element ({FE}) shape functions to map variables from surrounding nodes to material points and vice versa, independently of the locations of the material points within an element. In integration this leads to a quadrature rule error and, in strain and stress calculations, derivatives of typical {FE} shape functions are discontinuous across element boundaries and do not give accurate results away from Gauss point locations within elements. In geotechnical analysis, the constitutive behaviour is generally stress-dependent, and therefore stress oscillations can cause severe inaccuracies in the calculated mechanical behaviour, including the development of wrong elasto-plastic quantities. Several attempts to improve stress recovery and reduce quadrature errors have been developed, but seldom has a full comparison between methods been made. In this paper, benchmark small scale and slope stability problems have been examined in order to compare the relative performance of the classic material point method ({MPM}), the generalized interpolation material point ({GIMP}) method and the new composite material point method ({CMPM}).},

Iterative solution schemes, including relaxation and explicit time stepping, are summarized. A strain enhancement procedure that is useful when incompressibility is introduced through plasticity is presented next, followed by a slope stability example that compares the iteration characteristics and vertical crest displacement corresponding to explicit and implicit matrix-free algorithms. Two procedures for dealing with pore pressure generation related to incompressibility and undrained conditions are described and an example is presented to compare pore pressures.},

	abstract = {The material point method ({MPM}) combines an Eulerian and a Lagrangian description of the dynamic behaviour of materials. In recent years it has been extended to solve problems in soil mechanics. In particular, a code has been developed to analyse the response of saturated soils (Jassim, et al., 2012). The method is well adapted to deal with large displacements. {MPM} has a good potential to examine the conditions leading to slope failure but, also, it is capable of following in time the evolution of the unstable mass determining its final run-out, which is a key variable to evaluate the consequences of instability. Recently, a novel feature has been implemented in the code to simulate the excavation of soil. Within this work, the Selborne experiment has been modelled in order to contribute in the validation of the new excavation feature and the Mohr-Coulomb Strain Softening constitutive model. Furthermore, the influence of the initial stresses on the generated slip surface and the post-failure behaviour is studied.},

	abstract = {It has been 25 years since Sulsky and her co-workers developed the ﬁrst version of the material point method ({MPM}): a quasi particle method to solve continuum mechanics problems. In the {MPM}, the continua are discretized by Lagrangian particles moving over a ﬁxed Eulerian background grid. As a result, large deformation and contact can be treated effortlessly. Since then, many improved instances of the {MPM} have been developed and the {MPM} has found applications in many ﬁelds from geoengineering to movie industry. As the {MPM} has now been matured and a large body of literature on it exists, it is a good time to ponder and reﬂect on the developments of the method to date. To this end, this manuscript provides a concise introduction to the {MPM}, covering theory, implementation and applications. All the algorithms required to have a working {MPM} implementation for the simulations of solids, ﬂuids and their interactions are provided. We have coded these algorithms in in-house open source programs and used them to study the performance of different {MPM} variants for large deformation solid mechanics problems. These problems exhibit large plastic deformation, fractures and contacts. Convergence of different {MPMs} ({CPDI}, {GIMP}, B-splines, Total Lagrangian {MPM}, improved {MPMs}) are studied. Furthermore, {MPM} formulations for ﬂuids/gases and heat conduction are also covered. Potential areas for improvement on the method have been identiﬁed. The paper is the ﬁrst review of the {MPM} and presents a state-of-the-art of the current {MPM} literature covering 339 references.},

In this paper, the relationship between the undrained shear strength of clay and the measured cone tip resistance is investigated through numerical analysis. Such analyses serve to refine and establish correlations between cone penetration testing measurements and soil properties; thus enabling more reliable predictions of soil properties. The presented analyses are performed by means of a Material Point Method that has been developed specifically for the analysis of quasi-static geotechnical problems involving large deformations of soil. Both, the load-type dependency of the shear strength of undrained clay as well as the influence of the anisotropic fabric of natural clay on the undrained shear strength are taken into account through a new material model, the Anisotropic Undrained Clay model. Results indicate that the deformation mechanism relevant for cone penetration in undrained normally-consolidated clay differs significantly from predictions based on the Tresca model, but resulting cone factors appear to be useful.},

Three cutting-edge technologies were integrated into one numerical analysis tool: (1) a large-deformation analysis using the updated Lagrangian formulation, (2) a stable numerical algorithm for the solution of progressive failure in strain-softening materials, and (3) an h-adaptive mesh reﬁnement algorithm. The signiﬁcance of this study is mainly in the adoption of a proper numerical discretization for cases of slope failure in which large deformations lead to distortion of the ﬁnite-element mesh, unreliable results, and lack of convergence. The h-adaptive remeshing technique is used to reﬁne the ﬁnite-element mesh around the area of large shear strain, thereby improving the accuracy and convergence of numerical solutions. This study presents a method that can be used to simulate the failure of slopes with highly strain-softening materials that experience large deformations, so that postfailure deformations can be determined. The validity of the method is demonstrated through simulation of the failure and deformation of a highway embankment, and comparing the predicted deformations with the observed record. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){GM}.1943-5622.0000440. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The material point method is an evolution of particle-in-cell methods which utilize two meshes, one a material or Lagrangian mesh defined over material of the body under consideration, and the second a spatial or Eulerian mesh defined over the computational domain. Although meshes are used, they have none of the negative aspects normally associated with conventional Eulerian or Lagrangian approaches. The advantages of both the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods are achieved by using the appropriate frame for each aspect of the computation, with a mapping between the two meshes that is performed at each step in the loading process. The numerical dissipation normally displayed by an Eulerian method because of advection is avoided by using a Lagrangian step; the mesh distortion associated with the Lagrangian method is prevented by mapping to a user-controlled mesh. Furthermore, explicit material points can be tracked through the process of deformation, thereby alleviating the need to map history variables. As a consequence, problems which have caused severe numerical difficulties with conventional methods are handled fairly routinely. Examples of such problems are the upsetting of billets and the Taylor problem of cylinders impacting a rigid wall. Numerical solutions to these problems are obtained with the material point method and where possible comparisons with experimental data and existing numerical solutions are presented.},

The most common soil classiﬁcation systems used in geotechnical engineering are based on physical (textural) characteristics such as grain size and plasticity. Ideally, geotechnical engineers would also like to classify soils based on behaviour characteristics that have a strong link to fundamental in situ behaviour. However, existing textural-based classiﬁcation systems have a weak link to in situ behaviour, since they are measured on disturbed and remolded samples. The cone penetration test ({CPT}) has been gaining in popularity for site investigations due to the cost-effective, rapid, continuous, and reliable measurements. The most common {CPT}-based classiﬁcation systems are based on behaviour characteristics and are often referred to as a soil behaviour type ({SBT}) classiﬁcation. However, some confusion exists, since most {CPT}-based {SBT} classiﬁcation systems use textural-based descriptions, such as sand and clay. This paper presents an update of popular {CPT}-based {SBT} classiﬁcation systems to use behaviour-based descriptions. The update includes a method to identify the existence of microstructure in soils, and examples are used to illustrate the advantages and limitations of such a system.},

However, these estimates are performed based on empirical correlations without any scientific basis. Moreover, the test has a large inherent results dispersion due to the use of different types of equipment and execution procedures. Since the {NSPT} index depends on the amount of energy that is effectively transmitted to the sampler during the hammer fall, it is fundamental to be able to estimate this energy. Given the importance of estimating the energy that reaches the {SPT} sampler, an instrumented subassembly was developed in order to simultaneously assess the amount of energy transmitted to the drill rods, at sections just above the sampler and just below the anvil. This paper presents a series of {SPT} experimental results carried out in two different sites located in the State of São Paulo, using two different equipment set-ups (with manual and automatic tripping mechanisms), enabling the assessment of the top and bottom energy ratio under different conditions. Results show that for hand lifting hammer and automatic trip hammer systems the difference in the energy ratio is not significant. However, the dispersion of the results for the hand lifting hammer system is more pronounced due to execution procedures, equipment and operators.},

Although great effort has been put into standardizing the {SPT} procedure, variability is inherent in present procedures. Research has shown that the most significant factor affecting the measured N values is the amount of energy delivered to the drill rods. In order to reduce the significant variability of the {SPT} N-values due to the large variation in energy delivered, it has been recommended that the N value be
standardized to a specific energy level through the use of correction factors. The purpose of this research is to summarize all available correction factors and, with the guidance of a limited field-testing program, determine the most appropriate correction factor.
This report documents a field testing program in which energy delivered by three different hammer systems, one donut, one safety, and one automatic were measured. The resulting data are presented as well as conclusions regarding the determinations and use of correction factors in correcting the {SPT} N-value.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {A series of drained triaxial compression tests were performed on high-quality undisturbed samples of sandy soils for the determination of the angle of internal friction. The high-quality undisturbed samples were recovered by the in-situ freezing sampling method ({FS} sample). The angle of internal friction for the high-quality undisturbed samples was compared with calculations from the empirical equations proposed by many investigators previously using the N-value of the standard penetration test ({SPT}\}. It was found that the angle of internal friction for the high quality undisturbed sand samples was much higher than that estimated from the proposed empirical equations.
In order to take into account the effects of the confining stress on the {SPT} N-value, the measured N-value was normalized at an effective overburden pressure of 98 {kPa} (1 kgf / cm2) using the equation proposed by Liao and Whitman (1986). The normalized N-value, Ni, was induced to relate the angle of internal friction for the high-quality undisturbed sand samples. A fairly good correlation between the N1 value and the {\textless}!{\textgreater}d({FS}) was established. Finally, based on the test results, a simple equation ({\textless}!{\textgreater}d(Fs)=(20N)0·5+20) was proposed to relate the N1 value and {\textless}!{\textgreater}d({FS}) of sandy soils in the range of N1 between 3.5 and 30, for this study.
The relationship between the angle of internal friction for the high-quality undisturbed gravel samples and the penetration resistance was also discussed. A new parameter of {NL}1 was introduced in order to relate to, where {NL}1 is the penetration resistance of the large scale penetration test ({LPT}\} normalized at an effective overburden pressure of 98 {kPa} (1 kgf/cm2), using a similar equation to that proposed by Liao and Whitman (1986). Although data is limited, a correlation between {NLI} and similar to that proposed in this study for sandy soils was found.},

	title = {A Review of Basic Soil Constitutive Models for Geotechnical Application},
	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Solutions in soil constitutive modeling have been based upon Hooke’s law of linear elasticity for describing soil behaviour under working loading condition and Coulomb’s law of perfect plasticity for describing soil behaviour under collapse state because of its simplicity in applications. The combination and generalization of Hooke and Coulomb’s law is formulated in a plasticity framework and is known as Mohr-Coulomb model. However, it is well known that soils are not linearly elastic and perfectly platic for the entire range of loading. In fact, actual behaviour of soils is very complicated and it shows a great variety of behaviour when subjected to different conditions. Various constitutive models have been proposed by several researchers to describe various aspects of soil behaviour in details and also to apply such models in finite element modelling for geotechnical engineering applications. Recent published evolution of models used for soft soils and tunnels for the past 30 years was also presented. It must be emphasized here that no soil constitutive model available that can completely describe the complex behaviour of real soils under all conditions. This paper attempts to collaborate the efforts from various researchers and present the discussion on each models with advantages and limitations for the purpose of giving an overview comparison of various soil models for engineering applications.},

Five types of concrete sample were used to study the effect of surface shape on the stress displacement relationship. The soil used in this research were compacted clay and compacted sandy clay which was prepared by artificially mixing 75\% of sand and 25\% of clay. It was found that the failure line of clay concrete interface is approximately linear while the response of the sandy clay concrete interface can be represented by log function. The shape of surface of concrete has a great effect on the stress-sliding displacement. It was concluded that the sliding displacement governs the clay concrete interface response and deformation displacement governs the sandy clay concrete interface response.},

	abstract = {The sources of uncertainty, variability and bias in the performance of the Standard Penetration Test were identified using an extensive literature review and were classified in a manner that should assist the practice in recognizing and reducing them. These uncertainties and additional uncertainties introduced in the design process are then incorporated in a reliability-based evaluation of the design of shallow foundations. The results of the reliability analyses show that the factor of safety approach can provide an impression of degree of conservatism that is often unrealistic. At times, foundations with smaller factors of safety have smaller probabilities of failure than foundations with higher factors of safety. The reliability-based approach provides rational design criteria, accounting for all key sources of uncertainty in the foundation engineering process, and thus should be the basis of design.},

	abstract = {A series of full-scale lateral load tests of fully instrumented piles in cohesive soils were carried out to assess the lateral response of piles in free-field and near a slope condition. The test piles were loaded laterally using a hydraulic actuator to observe load-displacement relationship at loading elevation, axial strain response, and rotation response. It was found that the proximity of slope significantly affects the maximum lateral load capacity of the piles, but not significantly when the piles are installed at 8D (where D is pile diameter) or greater from the slope crests. In addition, it was observed all the piles except the 0D pile resulted in similar initial stiffness for the load-displacement curves, and the piles closer to the slope showed less passive resistance at smaller displacement. Using the test records, p-y curves for each test pile were back-calculated. By normalizing the p-y curves for the piles near the slope with the ones on the level ground at any soil displacement and depth, the p-multipliers accounting for the slope effects in lateral load analysis are derived. Based on the calculated p-multipliers, it was found that effects of adjacent slope to lateral behaviors of piles can be explained as a function of soil displacements; the p-multipliers are larger at small soil displacements and vice-versa. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){GT}.1943-5606.0001805. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Several noteworthy stability failures occurred at landfills in the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s, a timeframe coinciding with the promulgation of modern {US} environmental regulations. These failures were extensively studied, and lessons were learned. A stateof-practice developed to enable the design of waste fills to be stable throughout their construction, operation, and closure periods. However, a survey of landfill performance in the United States in the 2010–2019 timeframe shows that waste fill stability failures continue to occur. This paper, an expansion of the 2018 Terzaghi Lecture given by the first author, presents a brief review of several waste fill failures from the 1980s and 1990s and the lessons learned during that period. Several more recent waste fill failures are then reviewed, from which it is concluded that 20–30 years after the earlier failures, facility operators and design engineers are relearning the earlier lessons, as well as new lessons related to evolving waste streams and operating practices. The paper concludes with a discussion of the current standard-of-care for the design of {US} waste fills and suggests that this standard can be improved through application of the lessons described herein. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}) {GT}.1943-5606.0002291. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The Natomas basin is a 21,450-ha area north of downtown Sacramento, California. The developed area relies on levees for flood protection along its perimeter. The western boundary is a 29.9-km-long levee that protects the area from flooding by the Sacramento River. Since its construction over a century ago, this levee has experienced a myriad of performance issues. From 2008 to 2011, a team of engineers completed design and construction of remedial measures with the objective of ending the historic performance issues. Along one stretch, the Sacramento River and levee make a sharp bend at a constant levee radius of approximately 515 m. During the design processes, the levee was analyzed using a two-dimensional plane strain model despite this relatively sharp convex bend. This paper presents a review of the plane strain and axisymmetric formulations in which it is shown that the radial (horizontal) scale of the axisymmetric formulation is not arbitrary and requires additional planning by the modeler. A comparison of the results (seepage gradients and computed factor of safety for stability) from numerical modeling of levees using plane strain and axisymmetric formulations through the use of a case history is then presented. The computed gradients for the convex axisymmetric case are higher than those computed using a plane strain formulation. For the cross sections used in this study, the increase is greater than previously reported. Moreover, the increase is not systematic and is unique to each cross section. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){GT}.1943-5606.0001255. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Estimation of Newmark sliding displacement plays an important role for evaluating seismic stability of slopes. Current empirical models generally utilize predefined functional forms and relatively large model uncertainty is involved. On the other hand, machine learning method typically has superior capacity in processing comprehensive data sets in a nonparametric way. In this study, a machine learning framework is proposed to predict Newmark sliding displacements using the extreme gradient boosting model ({XGBoost}) and the Next Generation Attenuation ({NGA})-West2 database, where the subset simulation ({SS}) is coupled with the K-fold cross validation ({CV}) technique for the first time to tune hyperparameters of the {XGBoost} model. The framework can achieve excellent generalization capability in predicting displacements and prevent data overfitting by using optimized hyperparameters. The developed data-driven Newmark displacement models can better satisfy both sufficiency and efficiency criteria, and produce considerably smaller standard deviations compared with traditional empirical models. Application of the models in probabilistic seismic slope displacement hazard analysis is also demonstrated. The proposed {SS}-{XGBoost} framework has great potential in developing data-driven prediction models for a wide range of engineering applications. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){GT}.1943-5606.0002297. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},
